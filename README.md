# Locos-

This project was made only for academic purpose. With the idea to extend our knowledge about modular programming.
To run the program you need to run first Infrabel, this starts the server and afterwards NMBS.

The only remark that I got during my project defence is that. The GUI instantiation has to be separated of NMBS.

Documentation is also proided in the project folder.

# Locos-

This project was made only for academic purpose. With the idea to extend our knowledge about modular programming.
To run the program you need first to run Infrabel, this starts the server and afterwards NMBS.
The GUI could have been better but this is not one of the main goals of the project.

The only remark that I got during my project defence is that. The GUI instantiation has to be separated of NMBS.

Documentation is also provided in the project folder.
